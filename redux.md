# Redux

```javascript
```

Central store to all the app.
When a value changes, it is available for all the app

---

## Combine Reducer

---

Merges all the reducers

Will give access to all the states:

### useSelector()

Will allow us to get data out of the store

```javascript
useSelector(state  => state.[nameOfTheReducerInRouteReducerInAppJS])
